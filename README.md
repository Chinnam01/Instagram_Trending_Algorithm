# Instagram_Trending_Algorithm

 The Instagram Trending algorithm is a complicated system that decides what users see
on their Explore pages. It changes what people see and interact with, which has an effect on the
people who make material and the experience of all users. But no one knows how this program
works on the inside.

I've come up with testable theories and success metrics that will help us figure out how the
Instagram Trending algorithm works. It is important to keep in mind that these hypotheses are
just guesses and may change as we learn more about the data. Here are some starting ideas and
ways to measure success:

There is a good relationship between the number of likes, comments, and shares
on a post and its chance of being featured on the Explore page.
Success Metric: Find the correlation coefficient between the interaction metrics of a post and
how visible it is on the Explore page. There is a good correlation between user engagement and
content visibility.

Tools for data analysis:
The tools I'm going to use for the first step of exploring the data are Python with libraries like
Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, as well as Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
Tools for Modeling: I'm going to use R Studio or Excel for modeling and stats modeling and
data display.
Presentation and Visualization: I plan to use PowerPoint for slideshows and tools like Tableau
or Power BI to see how the data is organized.
